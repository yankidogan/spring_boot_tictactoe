# Tic-Tac-Toe with Spring Boot

In this project, Spring Framework of Java is used to make a tic-tac-toe game. Two players (one of them is X, and the other one is O) play their moves using a REST API controller. Players can start a new game, get the board state, check for the winner and get player statistics using defined REST endpoints.

Each move is saved to a H2 database using Entity classes and JPA.
